The FR4133 microcontroller on the LaunchPad comes pre-programmed with a 
User Experience demo when it's shipped from TI. This demo is also sometimes 
called the Out-of-the-Box (OOB) program.

At the end of this Code Composer Studio lab, the lab directions instruct you to 
import the project from the MSPWare code examples. For example, in MSPWare 2.21, 
you can find the project at the following location:

    C:\ti\msp\MSPWare_2_21_00_39\examples\boards\MSP-EXP430FR4133\MSP-EXP430FR4133_Software_Examples
    
And import project:

    OutOfBox_MSP430FR4133
