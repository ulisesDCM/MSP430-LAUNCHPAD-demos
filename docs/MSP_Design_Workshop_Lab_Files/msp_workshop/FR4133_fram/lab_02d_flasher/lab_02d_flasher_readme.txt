The MSP430Flasher utility lets you program a device without the need for Code 
Composer Studio. It can actually perform quite a few more tasks, but writing 
binary files to your board is the only feature that we explore in this exercise.

We provided two DOS batch files to make it easier to invoke MSP430Flasher. The
first one is for the User Experience demo that ships with the Launchpad. The 
other is for the simple blink program created in lab_02b_blink.

Before using the batch files, please verify that the path settings in the batch
files are correct. The paths we put in the files were based on the the lab and 
workshop installation instructions.

In case you have not completed the previous lab exercises and just want to 
reprogram the Launchpad, we have placed the binary files along with their
associated batch files in the subdirectory entitled, "local_copy".
