lab_04b_wdt

This lab takes lab_02a_ccs (which does a simple printf) and experiments with the
watchdog timer. In a way, we're playing "Can you beat the clock?"  ;-)

General Procedure
- Comment out WDT hold function in our lab4a code to see that the watchdog
  prevents us from ever getting to our blinking LED
- Import lab_02a_ccs solution and rename to lab_04b_wdt
- Modify printf() and put it into a while loop to count/print the # of times we 
  run thru the while{} loop
- Add the driverlib library
- Run the code and view how many times the while loop runs when invoking the
  watchdog timer with different clock rates (playing with the clock divider value)
- Finally, we import a program from the driverlib examples to see a way to 
  visualize the watchdog timer resetting the CPU

DANGER, DANGER, DANGER ...

As we said before, in a 'real-world' MSP program, you would NOT want to call 
printf(). This function is slow, requires a great deal of program and data 
memory, and uses too much power – all bad things for any embedded application.
